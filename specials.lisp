(defparameter *description*
  "The humble Farmer is a Maine humorist and former
jazz musician. Now an aged social commentator, he has been compared
with Mark Twain, Jean Shepherd, Art Buchwald and Garrison Keillor.

After each rant humble plays classic jazz from the 30s, 40s or 50s. He
panders to the intelligentsia. Thank you for listening.")
