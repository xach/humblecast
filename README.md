# Humblecast

I created this project to help my friend, Robert Karl Skoglund. He's
famous as The humble Farmer, and for many years he has produced a
radio program with old fashioned music and dry humor. In the past
decade or so, he has posted MP3s of the programs to
[his website](http://www.thehumblefarmer.com/MainePrivateRadio.html).

This program archives the MP3 files on Amazon S3 and creates a podcast
file for them, also hosted on S3.
